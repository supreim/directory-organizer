Create folders that are labelled after file types and move the correct file types to an appropriate directory

### Why I started this project
+ I looked in my downloads directory and thought, *my god...* 

### What I learnt

+ A short way of doing an if statement 
+ Check if an item is a directory or not
+ check the file type of an item
